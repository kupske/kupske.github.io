# Current research projects
## (2023~present) Embodied cognition, body aesthetics and L2 Phonology
  
*[Projeto Registrado (Open Science Framework)]* Embodied cognition theory posits that cognitive processes are influenced by sensory and motor experiences, including body aesthetics — how individuals perceive and evaluate their own bodies and bodily actions and those of others (Kupske, 2024). On this note, this project aims at investigating the role of embodiment and body aesthetics in L2 speech perception, processing and development. 

--> Subproject (a): **(2024~present) Body aesthetics and L2 speech perception**: L2 speech perception involves complex interactions among auditory, visual, and social cues. In this sence, this 1-year research project aims at investigating the role of body aesthetics (race, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation) in L2 speech perception (intelligibility, comprehensibility and degree of accent), contributing to our understanding of multimodal and multidimensional processing in L2 speech perception. 
- **Team:** Dr. Felipe Flores Kupske (UFRGS, CNPq); Laura Beatriz Wermuth (PIBIC-UFGRS, CNPq).  
- Grant total: R$ 8.400,00. 

## (2023~present) Teaching Pronunciation and Speaking in the Global South 

Integrating embodied cognition and decolonial perspectives into L2 speaking and pronunciation teaching practices can offer innovative approaches to address linguistic inequalities and promote social justice in language education. This research project aims to explore how embodied cognition and decoloniality can inform the teaching of L2 speaking and pronunciation.  

## (2023~present) First language attrition and speech perception

*[Projeto Registrado (Compesq-Letras, UFRGS)]* In the area of first ​​language attrition (FLA), studies that attempt to elucidate phonetic-phonological issues are the most scarce. Phonetic-phonological attrition is, therefore, a small area when compared to others (e.g., lexicon or syntax) and represents a scientific gap to be filled. Furthermore, the few studies on Brazilian phonetic-phonological attrition only focus on speech production without considering perception. Thus, in light of Complex Dynamic Systems Theory (CDST), based on Laboratory Phonology, this project seeks to investigate the dynamics of speech perception in the development of English-L2 and, with special attention, in the attrition of BP-L1.

--> Subproject: **(2023~2024) Creating perception tasks**: 
- **Team:** Dr. Felipe Flores Kupske (UFRGS, CNPq); Bettina Vasata De Oliveira (PIBIC-UFGRS, CNPq).  
- Grant total: R$ 8.400,00.
